# A link to the video recording file here (let me know if you have any problems accessing this)

# 4 blank asset sheets including the IHT calculations underneath the individual sections – please let me know if you need this broken down further

# The table with the fields and filters for the different sections

# A couple of example completed asset sheets (I’ve included their Salesforce Household ID in the title of each example. This is what I’ll be using to pull for each sheet)
