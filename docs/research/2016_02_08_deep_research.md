UK Inheritance Tax: Comprehensive Rulebook for Calculator Development

Overview and Scope of UK Inheritance Tax (IHT)

Inheritance Tax (IHT) in the UK is a tax on the estate (property, money, and possessions) of a person who has died. In general, a 40% tax rate applies to the portion of an estate’s value above the tax-free threshold (the “nil-rate band”, currently £325,000) ￼ ￼. If at least 10% of the net estate is left to charity, the rate on the taxable portion is reduced to 36% ￼.

Importantly, the geographical scope of IHT depends on the deceased’s domicile or long-term residence status. A person who is UK-domiciled (or deemed domiciled) is subject to IHT on their worldwide assets, whereas a person considered non-UK domiciled (based abroad) is only liable on their UK assets ￼. (Note: As of April 2025, the UK has shifted to a long-term residence test for domicile – generally treating individuals as UK-domiciled for IHT if they lived in the UK for 10 or more of the last 20 years ￼ ￼. Conversely, someone based abroad (non-dom or not meeting the long-term residence test) usually pays IHT only on UK-sited assets.)

Nil-Rate Band and Residence Nil-Rate Band
	•	Basic Nil-Rate Band (NRB): Every estate can pass up to £325,000 tax-free (the standard NRB). This threshold has been frozen at £325k for recent years. Any portion of the estate value above this threshold is taxable at 40% (unless reduced by reliefs or the charity rate) ￼. The unused NRB of a deceased spouse or civil partner can be transferred to the survivor’s estate – effectively allowing a married/civil partner couple to pass on up to £650,000 tax-free if the first death did not use their NRB ￼.
	•	Residence Nil-Rate Band (RNRB): In addition to the basic NRB, an extra £175,000 allowance may apply if a home (primary residence) is left to direct descendants (children, grandchildren, etc.) ￼. This residence nil-rate band (introduced from 2017) is per person and is also transferable to a surviving spouse if unused ￼. The RNRB is capped by the value of the residence passed on; you cannot claim more RNRB than the value of the home (or the share of it) left to descendants ￼ ￼. Estates above a certain size do not get the full RNRB – it tapers away for very large estates: specifically, the RNRB is reduced by £1 for every £2 that the total estate exceeds £2 million (so estates far above £2M may lose this allowance entirely) ￼. In practice, you subtract any available RNRB from the taxable estate value (after NRB) to further reduce or eliminate the IHT on that portion ￼.

Exemptions for Transfers (Spouse, Charity, etc.)

Certain transfers of assets are exempt from IHT altogether, either during life or on death:
	•	Spouse or Civil Partner Exemption: Assets left to a spouse or civil partner are generally fully exempt from IHT, regardless of amount ￼ ￼. This allows spouses to inherit without tax. (One caveat: if the surviving spouse is not UK-domiciled while the deceased was UK-domiciled, the spouse exemption is capped at the NRB amount – effectively £325,000 for transfers after 2013 ￼. Beyond that, excess transfers would use up the NRB or be taxed. However, a non-domiciled spouse can elect to be treated as UK-domiciled for IHT to get the full unlimited exemption in exchange for their worldwide assets becoming chargeable.)
	•	Charitable Gifts: Any assets left to registered charities (or certain national institutions) are exempt from IHT ￼. Moreover, as noted, leaving ≥10% of the net estate to charity reduces the IHT rate on the rest of the estate to 36% ￼.
	•	Political Parties and Other Exempt Beneficiaries: Gifts to qualifying political parties, housing associations, and for national/public purposes (like museums, universities, the National Trust, etc.) are also exempt by statute (these are less common but part of the rulebook).
	•	Small Gifts and Annual Exemptions: The law allows certain lifetime gifts to be exempt (see next section). For example, up to £3,000 per year of gifts can escape IHT (the annual exemption, which can be carried over one year if unused) ￼. You can also give unlimited small gifts up to £250 to any number of individuals each tax year (as long as you haven’t used another allowance on the same person) ￼. These small gifts are exempt and do not count toward the £3,000 annual limit. Additionally, certain wedding or civil partnership gifts are exempt up to set amounts: e.g. £5,000 to a child, £2,500 to a grandchild/great-grandchild, or £1,000 to anyone else, per marriage ￼.
	•	Normal Expenditure out of Income: If a person makes regular gifts out of their after-tax income (not from their capital) and these gifts do not affect the giver’s standard of living, they are treated as exempt as well ￼ ￼. This is known as the “normal expenditure out of income” exemption. To qualify, the gifts should be part of a pattern or regular commitment and be made from income that is surplus to the donor’s needs ￼. (For example, paying a grandchild’s rent monthly from one’s pension income, while still retaining enough income to cover one’s own expenses, could be exempt as normal expenditure.)
	•	Transfers to Disabled Trusts: Special rules allow gifts into certain trusts for disabled persons to be made without immediate IHT. A gift into a trust for a vulnerable or disabled beneficiary can be treated as potentially exempt (no 20% charge on transfer) as long as the donor survives 7 years ￼. Such trusts are also not subject to the usual 10-year and exit charges (discussed later) as long as the assets continue to benefit the disabled person ￼.

Business and Agricultural Reliefs

In addition to outright exemptions, reliefs can reduce the taxable value of certain assets, often to zero, to promote continuity of businesses or farms:
	•	Business Property Relief (BPR): Qualifying business interests can get 50% or 100% relief (a reduction in value for IHT purposes) ￼ ￼. 100% BPR applies to a business or an interest in a business, or to shares in an unlisted (private) company ￼. 50% BPR applies to assets like shares controlling >50% of voting rights in a listed company, or land, buildings, or machinery owned by the deceased and used in a company they controlled or a partnership they were in, etc. ￼. In effect, BPR can completely eliminate IHT on many family businesses or farms and  halve the taxable value of certain business-connected assets. To qualify, the asset generally must have been owned for at least 2 years prior to death ￼ and the business must be a trading business (not mainly investment in property or securities) ￼. (Businesses that primarily deal in investments or property rentals, for example, do not qualify for BPR ￼.)
	•	Agricultural Property Relief (APR): Agricultural property – such as farmland, buildings, or pasture used in farming – can qualify for up to 100% relief as well ￼ ￼. Typically, 100% APR is available if the owner farmed the land themselves, or the land was let on a qualifying farm tenancy, etc., whereas 50% APR applies in other cases (for example, older tenancies or if certain conditions are not met) ￼ ￼. To get APR, the property usually must have been owned and used for agriculture for a minimum period (2 years if occupied by the owner or their company; 7 years if occupied by someone else) immediately before transfer ￼. APR is limited to the “agricultural value” of the property (the value for farming purposes, ignoring any development or non-farming value) ￼ ￼. Note: You cannot double-claim BPR and APR on the same asset – if an asset qualifies for APR, you apply that first, and BPR can only potentially cover any remaining value not covered by APR ￼.
	•	Other Reliefs: There are a few other niche reliefs (e.g. Woodland Relief which defers IHT on the value of timber until it’s sold, and relief for certain heritage assets if preserved for the public), but the key ones for a calculator are BPR and APR, which often effectively remove qualifying business or farm assets from the taxable estate by reducing their taxable value (often by 100%).
	•	Quick Succession Relief (QSR): This is a relief to mitigate double-taxation when the same assets are subject to IHT in quick succession. If someone inherits assets (and IHT was paid on them) and then dies within 5 years, QSR reduces the IHT on those assets in the second estate ￼. The reduction is a percentage based on how soon the second death follows the first. (For example, if the second death occurs within 1 year of the first, the IHT on the inherited assets is reduced by 100%; within 1–2 years, by 80%; 2–3 years 60%; 3–4 years 40%; 4–5 years 20%. After 5 years, no QSR applies.) ￼ This relief recognizes that assets could otherwise be taxed twice in a short period and provides a sliding credit.

Lifetime Gifts and the 7-Year Rule

One of the most important sets of rules for an IHT calculator involves lifetime gifts and the 7-year survivorship rule. Gifts made during a person’s life can be tax-free if the person survives 7 years after making the gift ￼. Here’s how it works in detail:
	•	Potentially Exempt Transfers (PETs): Most outright gifts to other individuals (or to bare trusts) are treated as potentially exempt transfers. A PET incurs no immediate IHT when made. If the donor survives more than 7 years from the date of the gift, that gift becomes fully exempt – it will not be counted in the estate or trigger tax ￼. However, if the donor dies within 7 years, the PET “fails” and becomes a chargeable transfer that must be taken into account for IHT.
	•	Taper Relief: If death occurs between 3 and 7 years after a gift, any IHT due on that gift is reduced by taper relief. This does not reduce the value of the gift itself, but reduces the tax rate on that gift. The taper relief scale is as follows ￼ ￼:
	•	Gifts made 3–4 years before death: taxed at 32% (instead of 40%) ￼
	•	4–5 years before death: 24%
	•	5–6 years before death: 16%
	•	6–7 years before death: 8%
	•	7+ years before death: 0% (no tax, the gift is fully exempt) ￼.
Important: Taper relief only applies if the total of lifetime gifts in the 7-year window exceeds the nil-rate band. If the gifts are within the available threshold, there may be no tax to taper ￼. In essence, taper can reduce the rate of tax on a gift, but only for gifts that are sizable enough to be taxable in the first place (above the NRB).
	•	Order of Gifts and Threshold Allocation: When a person dies, any chargeable gifts they made in the 7 years prior to death are accounted for before the estate. The general rule is that earlier gifts use up the nil-rate band first, leaving less (or none) of the £325k threshold to apply to later gifts or the estate ￼ ￼. Practically, one would list all gifts in the 7-year lookback period (from oldest to newest):
	•	Apply the £325,000 threshold against those lifetime gifts in chronological order. Gifts made more than 7 years before death are ignored entirely (exempt).
	•	If the cumulative value of gifts within 7 years exceeds the threshold, then any excess portion of those gifts is taxed (at 40% or tapered rate) and typically the recipients of the gifts are responsible for paying that tax on their portion (once the £325k has been exhausted) ￼ ￼.
	•	Any part of the threshold used by lifetime gifts is not available to the estate itself on death ￼. In other words, lifetime gifts can eat into the tax-free band first, potentially leaving the estate with a smaller (even zero) available NRB.
	•	Example: Suppose someone dies and had made the following gifts: £50,000 nine years before death, £325,000 four years before death, and £100,000 three years before death. The £50k gift is ignored (outside 7 years) ￼. The £325k gift (4 years prior) fully uses the £325k NRB but itself incurs no tax because it exactly equals the threshold ￼. The subsequent £100k gift (3 years prior) finds the threshold already used up, so it is taxable. Being 3 years before death, it’s taxed at 40%, but since the threshold was exceeded, the donee must pay that tax – in this case £100k × 40% = £40,000 (though if it had been slightly over the threshold, only the amount over threshold would be taxed, often at a tapered rate if applicable) ￼. The estate on death then has no basic NRB left (it was all consumed by the £325k gift), so the estate itself is fully taxable (minus any spouse/charity exemptions or RNRB that might apply). In the example from HMRC’s guidance, a £100k gift made 3 years prior was taxed at 32% (after a larger gift used the threshold), resulting in £32k tax paid by the recipient, while the remaining estate paid 40% on its value ￼ ￼.
	•	Chargeable Lifetime Transfers (CLTs): Not all gifts are PETs. Gifts made into most types of trusts (and certain transfers to companies or other entities) are chargeable lifetime transfers. CLTs are subject to IHT at the time of the gift if they exceed the nil-rate band. In practice, when you make a transfer into a trust, you must consider the cumulative total of chargeable gifts in the past 7 years (similar to above). If the sum of the new transfer plus earlier chargeable gifts exceeds £325,000, 20% IHT is payable at transfer on the excess amount ￼ ￼. This 20% is the lifetime rate (half the death rate). Typically the trustees pay this 20% (out of the trust assets), but if the donor themselves pays the tax, it “grosses up” the transfer (the tax itself is considered an additional gift) resulting in a slightly higher effective tax – a complex calculation ￼.
	•	7-Year Rule on CLTs: If the donor dies within 7 years of making a CLT (e.g. a trust transfer), then an additional tax is due to bring the total up to the death rate of 40%. In essence, the initial 20% paid is topped up by another 20% from the estate, making it as if 40% had been paid on that transfer ￼. If no tax was paid initially (because the gift was within allowances at the time), then the full value of that transfer is added to the death estate’s chargeable total, potentially causing tax then ￼. If some tax was paid at transfer, credit is given for it – the estate would pay only the difference to reach 40%. Taper relief also can apply to these if death was 3-7 years after the transfer (reducing the top-up portion).
	•	The 14-Year Rule (Cumulative Period): There is a lesser-known “14-year” aspect to IHT: if someone made a CLT (like a trust gift) more than 7 years before death, that CLT itself is not taxed on death directly, but it can affect the tax on later gifts. Specifically, if a PET made within 7 years of death becomes chargeable, you must also look at CLTs made in the 7 years before that PET when calculating how much nil-rate band was available at the time of the PET ￼. In practical terms, this means a CLT up to 14 years before death can use up part of the nil-rate band, indirectly causing more of the later PET to be taxable. This often arises in scenarios where someone settled a trust (CLT), then 5 years later made another large gift (PET), and died within 7 years of the second gift – the earlier trust gift (within 7 years before the PET) reduces the available NRB for the PET calculation. While this is an edge case, a thorough calculator should account for it by looking at the full 14-year history for any gifts in that window.
	•	Who Pays the Tax on Gifts? By default, any IHT due on lifetime gifts that become chargeable is payable by the estate (the executors) – they add the gift’s tax to the estate’s IHT bill. However, if the total value of lifetime gifts exceeds the nil-rate band (£325k), then for the gifts above that threshold, the recipients of those gifts are in principle liable for the tax on their gift ￼. (The estate may still pay it and recover from them, but HMRC can pursue the donee for the tax on the gift if it’s not paid.) In many cases, the practical approach is the estate settles it, but it’s important to know the legal liability shifts once the NRB is exceeded by lifetime transfers.
	•	Documenting Gifts: For completeness, it’s advised that individuals keep clear records of any substantial gifts (what was given, to whom, when, and how much it was worth) ￼. This information will be needed by executors to correctly calculate IHT on the estate.

Gifts With Reservation of Benefit (GWR)

A critical anti-avoidance rule in IHT is the “gift with reservation of benefit” rule. This applies when someone gives away an asset but continues to benefit from it in some way. In essence, if you make a gift but don’t truly let go of the enjoyment or benefit of that asset, the asset will still count as part of your estate for IHT purposes, even if legal ownership was transferred ￼. Common examples of GWRs include ￼:
	•	House Gifting but Still Living There: e.g. giving your house to your children but continuing to live in it rent-free indefinitely. You’ve reserved a benefit (ongoing rent-free accommodation), so the house is treated as still yours for IHT ￼.
	•	Gifting Assets but Using Them: e.g. giving away a holiday home or a work of art to someone but still using it (staying in the holiday home, or hanging the painting in your own home) ￼.

If a gift is a GWR, two things happen: (1) it does not become an exempt PET after 7 years – instead it remains in the donor’s estate value at death; and (2) strictly, it can also be caught by an income tax charge called Pre-Owned Assets Tax (POAT) in some cases (beyond our scope here). For IHT calculation, the main point is to include GWR assets back into the estate.

Double Charges: Interestingly, a scenario could arise where a gift with reservation is made into a trust and a charge was paid, yet the asset is also in the estate (due to the reservation). The law prevents true double taxation; essentially the higher of the two potential charges will apply, not both ￼. For example, if you paid 20% on a trust transfer but kept benefiting from it so it’s in your estate, on death the estate could be charged 40%. In practice, the 40% at death would apply, but the initial 20% paid would be credited or ignored such that total does not exceed 40% ￼. The rules ensure you never pay more than 40% in total on the same asset even if it falls into both categories of charge ￼.

To avoid GWR treatment on say a house gift, the donor truly has to cease all benefit – e.g. if continuing to live in a gifted house, one must pay a market rent to the new owner to not trigger a “reservation of benefit” (this essentially makes it a normal arms-length arrangement). If a GWR situation isn’t cleaned up (benefit stopped) at least 7 years before death, the asset stays taxable in full.

Computing the Inheritance Tax on an Estate (Death Estate Calculation)

Bringing it all together, when someone dies, you need to compute how much of their estate is subject to IHT. A systematic approach (as also outlined in HMRC guidance ￼ ￼) is:
	1.	Aggregate the Estate’s Assets: List all assets owned by the deceased at death – e.g. property, bank accounts, investments, cars, personal valuables, etc. Use market values at date of death. The sum of all assets is the gross estate value ￼.
	2.	Subtract Liabilities and Debts: Deduct any debts, mortgages, or funeral expenses owed by the estate. This yields the net estate value ￼. (Only genuine debts outstanding at death are deductible – e.g. a mortgage on a property reduces that property’s value for IHT.)
	3.	Apply Reliefs (BPR/APR): If any assets qualify for Business Relief or Agricultural Relief, reduce their values accordingly at this stage. For instance, if a £1 million family business qualifies for 100% BPR, it may contribute £0 to the taxable estate ￼. If a farm qualifies for 100% APR, similarly its value (or the agricultural value portion) can be deducted. After reliefs, you have the value of the estate that is chargeable (absent exemptions) ￼.
	4.	Subtract Exempt Bequests/Transfers: Deduct the value of any assets left to exempt beneficiaries – chiefly, anything left to a spouse/civil partner, and gifts to charities (or other exempt bodies) ￼ ￼. These portions of the estate are not taxed. After removing spouse and charity (etc.) portions, the remainder is the chargeable estate (the part that will actually bear IHT).
	5.	Adjust for Lifetime Gifts (7-Year Rule): Determine the available nil-rate band for the estate by accounting for lifetime gifts. Take the standard £325,000 basic threshold, add any unused NRB transferred from a pre-deceased spouse, then subtract the value of any gifts made within 7 years of death ￼. Essentially, any chargeable lifetime gifts eat into this tax-free band first. If those gifts exceeded the NRB, they may have their own tax to account for (as discussed), but importantly they reduce or eliminate the NRB available to the estate ￼. Also add any Residence NRB (up to £175,000, plus any transferred RNRB from a spouse) to increase the available threshold if the home is inherited by direct descendants ￼ ￼. The result is the total effective tax-free threshold available against the estate at death.
	6.	Determine the Taxable Amount and Rate: Compare the chargeable estate value (step 4) to the available threshold (step 5). If the chargeable estate is less than or equal to the threshold, no IHT is due ￼. If it exceeds the threshold, IHT is charged on the excess above the threshold at 40% (or 36% if the reduced rate applies due to charitable bequests) ￼ ￼.
	•	Residence NRB application: The RNRB (if applicable) is effectively a further deduction in step 5. Notably, the RNRB cannot create a refund – it only can reduce the taxable estate to zero if sufficient; any unused RNRB beyond that is simply unutilized. And remember it tapers off for very large estates (so step 5’s threshold might be lower if estate > £2M) ￼.
	•	Charity rate: If ≥10% of the net estate is left to charity, ensure the IHT rate applied is 36% rather than 40% ￼.
	•	Lifetime gift tax: Any tax due on gifts (from gifts exceeding NRB, as calculated separately) should also be taken into account. The estate might pay those or the recipients might, but for a complete picture, a calculator should flag any gift tax liabilities as well.
	7.	Apply any Remaining Reliefs/Credits: If Quick Succession Relief is relevant (the deceased themselves inherited taxable assets within the last 5 years), compute the reduction in tax on those assets per the percentages noted and subtract that from the tax bill ￼. Also consider if foreign tax credits apply (if any asset is taxed by another country’s estate tax and a treaty credit is available).
	8.	“Grossing Up” for Tax-Free Gifts in Will (if applicable): If the will specifies that a certain bequest is to be received “free of tax” (meaning the estate should bear the IHT on that gift), a grossing-up calculation is needed. Essentially, the taxable value of that gift is inflated such that after the estate pays the tax, the beneficiary still receives the intended net amount ￼. Grossing up often comes into play when part of the estate is exempt (e.g. charity) and part is taxable with some gifts tax-free – it ensures the 40% (or 36%) tax is correctly computed on the taxable portion taking into account that the tax itself is paid out of the estate. This can be complex, and HMRC provides calculators for grossing-up these scenarios ￼.

Finally, sum up the IHT due on the estate itself and any separate gift taxes. Typically, the IHT on the estate is payable by the executor out of the estate funds within 6 months of the end of the month of death (to avoid interest), whereas any gift tax that the estate doesn’t cover would be payable by the gift recipients. In practice, executors often coordinate it all.

Summary of Key Figures: To recap for a developer: the main inputs to an IHT calculation are the asset values and liabilities, reliefs on those assets, exemptions (spouse/charity), the history of gifts, and any transferable allowances. The main outputs are the net taxable estate value and the tax due, along with breakdowns (tax on lifetime transfers vs on estate, etc.).

Inheritance Tax on Trusts and Companies

In some cases, you may be calculating IHT involving assets held in or passing through trusts, or business assets held in company structures. These introduce additional rules:
	•	Transfers into Trust: As mentioned, putting assets into a trust (e.g. a discretionary trust) is a chargeable lifetime transfer. You must calculate immediately if that transfer (when added to previous 7-year gifts) exceeds £325,000. The portion above the threshold is taxed at 20% at the time of transfer ￼ ￼. If the settlor (person creating the trust) dies within 7 years, the transfer is then re-calculated at 40%, and an extra 20% is due from the estate ￼. If the settlor survives 7 years, no further tax on that transfer. (Certain trusts, like a trust for a disabled person, are excepted – no immediate charge, treating it more like a PET ￼.)
	•	Trusts created via Wills: When someone dies and their will directs assets into a trust, the IHT on those assets is determined as part of the estate settlement. For example, if a spousal trust is created (such as a life-interest trust for the spouse), it can qualify for spouse exemption (no IHT at first death) because the spouse is the beneficiary. Such a trust is often called an Immediate Post-Death Interest (IPDI) trust. Assets in an IPDI for a spouse are not subject to ongoing trust charges; instead, when the spouse later dies (terminating their life interest), those assets are taxed at 40% as part of the spouse’s estate ￼. In short, a trust that gives the spouse an immediate right to income is treated similarly to an outright bequest to the spouse for IHT: no tax upfront, but then taxed on the second death.
	•	Relevant Property Trust Regime: Most non-exempt trusts (e.g. discretionary trusts, many lifetime trusts) fall under the “relevant property” regime. Instead of being taxed only at death, these trusts incur periodic charges:
	•	A 10-year anniversary charge: On each 10-year anniversary of the trust’s creation, an IHT charge of up to 6% may apply to the trust’s value above the available nil-rate band ￼ ￼. In technical terms, the effective rate is 30% of the lifetime 20% rate (thus maximum 6%) ￼. The calculation for the 10-year charge takes into account the initial value settled, the nil-rate band (adjusted for the settlor’s previous gifts when the trust was set up), and any distributions made out of the trust in the interim. If the trust’s assets plus certain related settlements exceed the NRB, the excess is taxed at up to 6%. Assets qualifying for BPR or APR get those reliefs before calculating this charge ￼ ￼.
	•	Exit charges: When assets are distributed out of a relevant property trust to a beneficiary (or the trust winds up), an exit charge (also called a proportionate charge) may apply. This is essentially a pro-rated version of the 10-year charge for the time between the last 10-year anniversary and the exit. The maximum rate is also up to 6% of the value leaving the trust ￼. For example, if assets leave a trust 5 years into a 10-year period, roughly 5/10 of the 6% rate might apply (i.e. ~3% max). If assets are removed within 3 months after a 10-year charge or within 3 months of trust creation, there can be no exit charge (those are grace periods) ￼. There are also no charges if the trust property becomes exempt (e.g. passes to a charity or into a disabled person’s trust) ￼ ￼.
Note: The nil-rate band for trust charges is not per trust in full; if one settlor sets up multiple trusts, they effectively share a single NRB for periodic charges as at creation (settlements made the same day are also linked) ￼ ￼. Recent reforms also introduced a cap on trust charges for certain offshore trusts with formerly excluded property (capping at £5 million over 10 years) ￼, but this is a very specific scenario.
	•	Excluded Property: If a trust contains only excluded property (usually non-UK assets held by a non-UK domiciled settlor), then those assets are outside the scope of IHT – no 10-year or exit charges on them ￼. If the trust later holds UK assets or the settlor becomes UK-domiciled/long-term resident, then charges can arise.
	•	Trusts for Bereaved Minors or 18-25 Trusts: These are special trusts for children of deceased parents. Bereaved minors trusts (assets held for a child until 18) and 18-to-25 trusts have their own IHT treatment: generally no 10-year charges for bereaved minor trusts, and 18-25 trusts avoid 10-year charges but may incur a one-time exit charge if the trust goes beyond age 18 (since they must end by 25) ￼ ￼. These are niche but important for completeness. Essentially, these trusts (which arise from a parent’s death) get preferential treatment (no periodic charges, only a possible small exit charge) to allow flexibility in providing for young beneficiaries.
	•	Companies and Business Assets: While companies themselves don’t “die” (so they don’t pay IHT), an individual’s shares in a company are part of their estate. For majority shareholders or family business owners, BPR (Business Relief) often applies at 100%, as discussed, effectively removing those shares from IHT ￼. If BPR does not apply (say the company is an investment company or the shares are publicly traded without a controlling interest), then the shares’ market value at death is subject to IHT like any other asset. Special valuation rules ensure minority shareholdings are valued appropriately (possibly with discounts for lack of control). Also, if an individual had transferred assets into a company for less than full value (a common planning or accidental gift scenario), that could be treated as a gift (potentially a PET or CLT depending on circumstances) equal to the loss to their estate ￼. For example, selling a property to a company owned by your children for under market value is partly a gift (the difference between market value and price is a gift) ￼ ￼.
	•	Life Insurance in Trust: Many people put life insurance policies into trust so that on death the payout goes directly to beneficiaries and is outside the estate (not subject to IHT). If structured properly, the insurance payout is excluded from the estate and no IHT on it – which is beneficial since it can then be used to pay IHT on the estate, etc. A calculator might not need to handle this except to note if an insurance is not in trust, its payout is part of the estate.

In summary, involving trusts or companies mostly introduces the need to handle lifetime charges (20%), periodic 10-year and exit charges (max 6%), and recognizing when a trust transfer is exempt (spouse/charity/disabled) or when business relief applies to company shares. An inheritance tax “rulebook” should enumerate these scenarios so that any automated calculator can ask the right questions (e.g., Was this asset held in a trust? What type? Was it an IPDI for spouse or a discretionary trust?, etc.) and apply the correct rules.

Conclusion

This comprehensive set of rules provides the foundation for calculating UK Inheritance Tax in all common situations. In building a development specification for an IHT calculator, the above can be used as a checklist of modules or functions: handling thresholds and rates, applying exemptions, applying reliefs to asset values, tracking gifts and cumulations over 7 (or 14) years, calculating tapered gift tax, determining spouse and charity deductions, computing the residence band eligibility, and dealing with the special trust charges and life interest situations. All calculations should ultimately tie back to authoritative statutes and HMRC guidance so they can serve as a legal reference if needed. With these rules programmatically encoded and thoroughly tested (using edge-case scenarios like large gifts, complex estates with relief-qualifying assets, non-domiciled situations, and trusts), one can confidently compute inheritance tax liabilities in line with UK law and HMRC practice.
