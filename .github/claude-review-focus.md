## Repository-Specific Review Focus

- Ensure calculations remain deterministic and based on Decimal values.
- Confirm updated behavior is covered by unit and fixture integration tests.
- Flag any changes that could break milestone fixture parity (M1-M10).
- Verify new tax-year or fixture-loader changes do not regress historical fixtures.
- Treat mismatches in expected fixture outputs as high-priority defects.
