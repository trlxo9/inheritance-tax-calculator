The amount the estate is entitled to is reduced or tapered away for estates worth more than £2 million by £1 for every £2 over £2 million. In this example, the net estate after liabilities is £2,100,000. The estate is £100,000 over the taper threshold, so the available residence nil rate band is reduced by £50,000 to £75,000."
